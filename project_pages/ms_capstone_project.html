										<h2 id="content">Robotic Sensor Apparatus (RSA-System) For Nuclear Power Plant Facility Monitoring</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This project was my Robotics Masters Capstone Project and was a 
											culmination of a year and a half of research, development, prototyping, and evaluation. I was 
											able to create a whole product from conception to TRL 4 prototype demonstrated in a lab 
											environment over that time period.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Robotic Sensor Apparatus (RSA) system is a modular sensor hub 
											with onboard AI-powered processing, sensor fusion, and input power that can be fixed to 
											different mobile robot platforms to provide automated anomaly detection, classification, 
											and suggested repair/action mappings for those classifications. The RSA system was developed 
											and evaluated using data and scenarios provided by a flow loop test bench, and as a first 
											proof of concept, it has proved that it is deserving of continued development. This system is 
											intended to be configured for specific types of inspections or responses in nuclear power 
											plants.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This system is intended to be configured for specific types of inspections 
											or responses in nuclear power plants. It utilizes a library of machine learning models and computer 
											vision algorithms to support three main things:
											
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">1. Anomaly Detection: this would be accomplished utilizing the 
												outputs from a visible-spectrum camera and a thermal longwave infrared (LWIR) camera. 

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">2. Anomaly Classification: this would be done using multiple machine 
											learning classification models and custom algorithms to interface with the visible camera 
											imagery and the LWIR temperature pixel data. 

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">3. Suggested Repair/Action Guidance: this would be accomplished 
											using a policy map where a facility could map classifications to suggested actions. 

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system offers a custom, modular 3D printed composure that allows for 
											easy access to components, a module connection point that can be easily swapped out for integration 
											with different robot platforms and end effectors, and enough power and cooling to keep the 
											system operating for 3+ hours.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system utilizes a thermal (LWIR) radiometric camera and a visible 
											EO camera for the majority of its anomaly detection. The thermal camera can detect the 
											temperature of pixel values within the frame, while the visible camera can be utilized to detect 
											problems like rust, corrosion, and pipe leaks. 
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system utilizes a custom API that accesses and controls the cameras. 
											It also utilizes a custom stream handler class that can stream the feeds from the camera module out 
											to an external source via Ethernet/WiFi using Gstreamer with RTP over UDP. It turns the main 
											processing unit (Jetson Nano) into a video server that pushes the video frames out via UDP. A client 
											laptop can access the RSA system via the RSA Supervisor software. This software handles camera 
											streaming, pipeline, control, sensor data visualizations, and processed results (detections, 
											classifications, and suggested repairs/actions) from the RSA. This allows for a human technician 
											to be in a safe control zone operating the RSA from afar.
											
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Both custom and open-source datasets were curated for this project. The 
											open-source datasets did not have very high quality data and labels for rust/corrosion and pipe 
											leaks. To augment these datasets and provide better quality data, a custom dataset was extracted 
											from a flow loop test bed provided by the Intelligence for Advanced Nuclear Laboratory (iFAN Lab). 
											This test bed offered a physical nuclear power plant representation that this custom dataset could 
											be extracted from.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Two models were developed after rigorous training. A rust/corrosion model and 
											a pipe leak model. Both models performed very well in when verifying the system, with slightly better 
											performance on the rust/corrosion model.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For evaluation, four objectives were established (fully test software, test 
											onboard power, integrate a robot platform to prove modularity, and stream video and control system 
											via WiFi and Ethernet).
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The first evaluation objective was a software evaluation. The goal of this was 
											to test thermal anomalies, visible leak anomalies, and visible rust/corrosion anomalies. This was 
											achieved in the iFAN lab by testing on the flow loop test bed.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system onboard power also needed to be tested. This was done by simply running 
											the system at full functionality for a few hours. The system ran for well over 2 hours which would be 
											plenty of time for a standard inspection before a robot could return to its home station for recharging.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For robot integration, a Unitree B1 robot dog with a Z1 robot arm was selected. 
											This system was selected due to availability at Georgia Tech and was provided by the iFAN lab. The system 
											had a 3D printed custom connection point for this robot’s end effector, and the RSA system was mounted to 
											the robot. If a different end effector ever needed to be integrated with, the only change to the system
											 would be the 3D printed back plate that can be removed, modified, and re-attached whenever needed.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For streaming and control, the RSA Supervisor needed to be tested. To do this the 
											system was connected to a Wi-Fi network provided by the Unitree B3 robot and a client laptop was setup a 
											few meters away on that same network. A configuration file was set to stream video to the IP address of that 
											client laptop and the RSA Supervisor code was loaded on that machine. With the running of one bash file from 
											the client, both the thermal and the visible stream appeared on the screen of the Ubuntu laptop. RSA system 
											control also appeared on the client for supervised control of the processing pipeline. The robot was then 
											teleoperated around and anomalies were able to be detected and classified. Using those classifications, 
											suggested repair/action guidance was sent to the terminal in the client laptop. 
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This fully validated the RSA system in a lab environment. Further validation came 
											from a full integration test and demo performed with another iFAN team at ICRA 2025 in Atlanta, GA. The other 
											team was working on nuclear power plant robotic monitoring. This demo showed an integration of thermal and visible 
											monitoring provided by the RSA system and radiation detection and monitoring by the other iFAN team. This 
											demo won the best poster award at ICRA 2025.
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The qualitative outcomes of the three software test cases, the onboard power test, 
											the Unitree B3 integration, and the live-streaming of sensor data and system control point to the system’s 
											innovative design and operational efficiency. With the success of the ICRA 2025 sensor fusion demo and further 
											research already being performed by the Georgia Tech iFAN laboratory, this system will be receiving a lot of 
											further development. This initial evaluation phase emphasized the promise of the system, indicating that with 
											further refinement and comprehensive quantitative analysis, its applications could extend considerably. The 
											system's performance in these scenarios suggests that it holds significant potential, warranting continued
											 investment in its development to realize its full capabilities.
