										<h2 id="content">Robotic Sensor Apparatus (RSA-System) For Nuclear Power Plant Facility Monitoring</h2>

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_dog_flowloop_1.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This project was my Robotics Masters Capstone Project and was a 
											culmination of almost two years of research, development, prototyping, and evaluation. I was 
											able to create a whole product from conception to TRL 4 prototype demonstrated in a lab 
											environment over that time period. I came up with the initial concepts and successfully led a 
											team of four students in the development of this prototype. The project is still in active 
											development at Georgia Tech in the Intelligence for Advanced Nuclear Lab under Dr. Fan Zhang.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_team.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Robotic Sensor Apparatus (RSA) system is a modular sensor hub 
											with onboard AI-powered processing, sensor fusion, and input power that can be fixed to 
											different mobile robot platforms to provide automated anomaly detection, classification, 
											and suggested repair/action mappings for those classifications. The RSA system was developed 
											and evaluated using data and scenarios provided by a flow loop test bench, and as a first 
											proof of concept, it has proved that it is deserving of continued development.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_final_enclosure.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This system is intended to be configured for specific types of inspections 
											or responses in nuclear power plants. It utilizes a library of machine learning models and computer 
											vision algorithms to support three main things:
											
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">1. Anomaly Detection: this is accomplished utilizing the 
												outputs from a visible-spectrum camera and a thermal longwave infrared (LWIR) camera. 

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">2. Anomaly Classification: this is done using multiple machine 
											learning classification models and custom algorithms to interface with the visible camera 
											imagery and the LWIR temperature pixel data. 

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">3. Suggested Repair/Action Guidance: this is accomplished 
											using a policy map where a facility could map classifications to suggested actions.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_processing_pipeline.png" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">To accomplish this, the system needed to be modular, have on-board AI-powered processing, 
											sensor fusion, system-monitoring, extendibility, and simple operational control. The system also needed to be 
											demonstrated using some sort of test facility. 
										
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system offers a custom, modular 3D printed composure that allows for 
											easy access to components, a module connection point that can be easily swapped out for integration 
											with different robot platforms and end effectors, and enough power and cooling to keep the 
											system operating for 3+ hours.

										<div class="image-center">

										</div>

										<div class="image-center">

										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">There are currently three iterations of the RSA-System, with the latest (2.0) in development 
										in Spring 2026. The following table showcases the hardware as the system has evolved.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_version_history.png" alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system utilizes a thermal (LWIR) radiometric camera and a visible 
											EO camera for the majority of its anomaly detection. The thermal camera can detect the 
											temperature of pixel values within the frame, while the visible camera can be utilized to detect 
											problems like rust, corrosion, and pipe leaks on various parts found in a facility.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_thermal.png" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The system utilizes a custom API that accesses and controls the cameras. 
											It also utilizes a custom stream handler class that can stream the feeds from the camera module out 
											to an external source via Ethernet/WiFi using Gstreamer with RTP over UDP. It turns the main 
											processing unit (Jetson Nano) into a video server that pushes the video frames out via UDP. 
											These H264-encoded videos then needed to be converted into a WebRTC stream for ingestion into 
											the RSA Supervisor (the front end GUI). To do this a docker container called the RSA-Video-Restreamer 
											was established. 
											
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Additionally, a custom WebSocket library was implemented to send Anomaly, System Status, 
											and Anomaly Check messages back and forth between the RSA system and the RSA Supervisor. The System Status 
											includes information like GPS, temperature/humidity read outs, and battery fuel gauge information. 
											The Anomly message encapsulates a detected abnormal event by the RSA's onboard analytics system. It
											includes info such as sensor sources, classification result, confidence scorings, and recommended 
											operator actions. The Anomaly Check message can be sent from the RSA Supervisor to a specific deployed
											RSA System to run anomaly analysis on specific areas of interest.

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">All of this allows for a human technician to be in a safe control zone operating 
											the RSA from afar. Additionally, personnel that might not be as well trained as more experienced technicians, 
											could operate a robot to enter potentially hazardous areas and perform expert-level inspections on systems 
											and hardware.

										</div>
										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_supervisor.png" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The current network setup allows for multiple RSA systems to stream video and 
											websocket messages to a single processing server. The processing server hosts the RSA Supervisor web 
											application on the RSA network and allows any client laptop to access this GUI. From this web application, 
											these clients can control different RSA systems and view streams, anomalies, and suggested actions.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_network.png" alt="" />
										</div>
											
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">To train the convolutional neural nets, both custom and open-source datasets 
											were curated for this project. The open-source datasets did not have very high quality data and labels 
											for rust/corrosion and pipe leaks. To augment these datasets and provide better quality data, a custom 
											dataset was extracted from a flow loop test bed provided by the Intelligence for Advanced Nuclear Laboratory 
											(iFAN Lab). This test bed offered a physical nuclear power plant representation that this custom dataset 
											could be extracted from.

										</div>
										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_flowloop_table.png" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Three models were developed after rigorous training. A rust/corrosion model,  
											a pipe leak model, and a plant part classifier. All of these models performed very well when verifying 
											the system, with slightly better performance on the rust/corrosion and the plant part classifier models. 
											The plant part classifier was trained on six different classes (collected from the iFAN Flow Loop Test Bench):
											Buffer Tank, Fill Tank, Steam Generator, Nuclear Core Reactor, Motorized Valve, and Pump.

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For a quick validation of the PCC model, the model was run on the following video to get 
											these results:

										</div>	

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For the full system evaluation, three objectives were established (fully test software, integrate 
											a robot platform to prove modularity, and stream video and control system via WiFi and Ethernet).

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The first evaluation objective was a software evaluation. The goal of this was 
											to test thermal anomalies on different plant parts, test visible leak anomalies, and test visible 
											rust/corrosion anomalies. This was achieved in the iFAN lab by testing on the flow loop test bed.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_software_check.png" alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For robot integration, a Unitree B1 robot dog with a Z1 robot arm was selected. 
											This system was selected due to availability at Georgia Tech and was provided by the iFAN lab. The system 
											had a 3D printed custom connection point for this robot’s end effector, and the RSA system was mounted to 
											the robot. If a different end effector ever needed to be integrated with, the only change to the system
											 would be the 3D printed back plate that can be removed, modified, and re-attached whenever needed.

										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_close_up_6.jpg" alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For streaming and control, the RSA Supervisor needed to be tested. To do this the 
											system was connected to a Wi-Fi network provided by the Unitree B3 robot and a client laptop was setup a 
											few meters away on that same network. A configuration file was set to stream video to the IP address of 
											that client laptop and the RSA Supervisor code was loaded on that machine. The RSA-Video-Restreamer successfully 
											grabbed the streamed UDP video frames and converted it to the WebRTC stream to be picked up by the RSA Supervisor 
											Web GUI. Additionally, WebSocket messages such as Anomaly Checks, Anomalies, and RSA System Statuses were transmitted 
											across the network between the RSA system and the RSA Supervisor successfully. RSA system control was handled with 
											the Anomaly Check messages, while system monitoring and localization was handled by the Anomaly and Status messages 
											appearing on the RSA Supervisor web application. The robot was then teleoperated around and anomalies were able to 
											be detected and classified. Using those classifications, suggested repair/action guidance was sent to the RSA 
											Supervisor in the client laptop.
										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_supervisor_dog_lab_2.jpg" alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This fully validated the RSA system in a lab environment. Further validation came 
											from a full integration test and demo performed with another iFAN team at ICRA 2025 in Atlanta, GA. The other 
											team was working on nuclear power plant robotic monitoring. This demo showed an integration of thermal and visible 
											monitoring provided by the RSA system and radiation detection and monitoring by the other iFAN team. This 
											demo won the best poster award at ICRA 2025.

										</div>
										<div class="image-center">
											<img src="../images/project_images/rsa_icra.png" alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The qualitative outcomes of the three software test cases, the Unitree B3 integration, 
											and the livestreaming sensor data and system control point to the system’s innovative design and operational 
											efficiency. With the success of the ICRA 2025 sensor fusion demo and further research already being performed 
											by the Georgia Tech iFAN laboratory, this system will be receiving a lot of further development. This initial 
											evaluation phase underscored the promise of the system, indicating that with further refinement and comprehensive 
											quantitative analysis, its applications could extend considerably. The system's performance in these scenarios 
											suggests that it holds significant potential, warranting continued investment in its development to realize its 
											full capabilities. As a proof-of-concept, this system not only meets the theoretical expectations but also lays 
											a strong foundation for future advancements and practical implementations.

											Note that further improvements to the system have already been completed (such as RSA Supervisor, device monitoring, 
											and additional/improved AI models).
