												<h3>Project Director <br>

											</header>
											<p>I led the design and development of a modular edge-AI sensor hub for robotic systems, integrating onboard AI processing, real-time sensor fusion, and device health monitoring with automated anomaly classification and prescriptive maintenance tailored for nuclear power plant applications. I implemented low-latency computer vision and inference pipelines using Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics, with real-time video streaming via GStreamer and WebRTC in Dockerized Linux environments. I also built web-based visualization and control interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSockets, and deployed CUDA-accelerated AI workloads on NVIDIA Jetson platforms for edge computation and data collection. In parallel, I defined project scope, timelines, staffing, documentation standards, and configuration management while leading a five-engineer development team.</p>

											<p>I served as the sensor and data processing lead for the deployment of UAV systems equipped with custom EO/IR payloads. I developed C++- and ROS-based perception pipelines that integrated SLAM algorithms to generate synchronized point clouds and georeferenced mosaics for sponsor data deliveries and presentations. I built automated workflows to extract terrain traversability metrics and perform crater detection to support battlefield assessment. I was a core developer on the UAV software architecture, contributing to communication frameworks and Dockerized container deployments, and I deployed and tested software across Linux and Windows environments, including edge NVIDIA Jetson platforms. I also led live system demonstrations and data collection events, briefing warfighters and sponsors during high-visibility test activities.</p>

												<h3>Software Task Lead <br>

												<h4>ARMY/AMCOM</h4>
											</header>
											<p>I led a 10-engineer team in delivering a fully autonomous post-processing pipeline that analyzed over 100 TB of data collected during a 14-month counter-UAS deployment. I managed requirements and risk by gathering, analyzing, and prioritizing stakeholder needs while identifying potential vulnerabilities in the processing chain. I developed GPU-accelerated AI pipelines in Python and C++ using CUDA, PyTorch, and Ultralytics to generate target classifications, kinematics, summaries, and video products, and I briefed results to DoD sponsors and national laboratories including MIT-LL, Sandia, NRL, MITRE, and ORNL. I built automated visualization and reporting tools using Tkinter and GStreamer, specified and deployed the supporting data infrastructure—including AI servers, PostgreSQL databases, thin clients, and a 1.3 PB NAS—and established a standardized C-UAS dataset curation task force for benchmarking models and datasets.</p>

											<p>I served as a temporary task lead and core developer for an EO/IR air surveillance system supporting autonomous detect-track-prioritize-interrogate workflows for counter-UAS operations. I architected camera and gimbal control APIs, implemented autonomous state machines, and developed real-time centering and zoom algorithms to achieve a minimum viable product under aggressive deadlines. I built GPU-accelerated perception pipelines using C++, Python, CUDA, DeepStream, and GStreamer, served as the lead system integrator during successful field deployments, and briefed senior military and sponsor leadership, including Deputy Base Commanders and Director-level stakeholders.</p>

												<h3>Software Engineer <br> 
													Additional Project Contributions</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I was a key software developer responsible for converting prototype algorithms into deployable, real-time, unit-tested applications for atmospheric and bathymetric LiDAR systems. I developed GUI-based control, processing, and visualization software using .NET, C#, and C++, and I designed and validated a novel 2D line-fitting algorithm for ATR LiDAR processing that was selected for final sponsor delivery. I performed advanced 3D point-cloud analysis and bathymetric LiDAR processing for classified and unclassified programs using Python, Matlab, QGIS, and QT Modeler.</p>
