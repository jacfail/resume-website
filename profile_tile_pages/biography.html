										<h2 id="content">Biography</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Jacob Faile was born in Kentucky in 1998. He spent most of his childhood on the east coast of 
											the USA moving around Kentucky, Indiana, and Georgia. His family eventually settled in Rome, Georgia and Jacob completed 
											his high school education dual enrolling as a home schools student and a college student at Georgia Northwestern Technical
											College. After graduation, he enrolled in the pre-engineering pathway at Georgia Highlands College to complete all his core
											engineering core classes. During this time, Jacob Faile worked at the Chick-Fil-A Dwarf House in Rome, GA as a server. 
											He also worked as a runner for a law firm called Brinson Askew Berry in Rome, GA to help pay for his classes. During this time 
											Jacob spent a lot of his free time performing on stage and working backstage at Rome Little Theatre.

										</div>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">After completing his core classes at Georgia Highlands, Jacob transferred to the Southern Poly Tech 
											campus of Kennesaw State University to begin his specialization in Mechatronics Engineering. Jacob started working at the 
											Chick-Fil-A Dwarf House in Woodstock, GA to assist in paying his way through college. He also took on a Teaching Assistant roles
											at Kennesaw State University teaching classes and labs like Intermediate Programming for Mechatronics, Mechatronics Engineering Fundamentals,
											and Advanced Controls. His work at Chick-Fil-A and his work as a TA gave him scholarships that allowed him to continue working his 
											education at KSU.

										</div>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Jacob graduated Summa Cum Laude from KSU with a 4.0 GPA and quickly entered the work force. He took a job at Georgia
											Tech Research Institute in the Electro-Optical Systems Lab as an algorithm and analysis researcher working on both classified
											and unclassified DoD, DoW projects and private sponsored projects. He focused heavily on new research in robotics, algorithms, 
											machine learning, AI, and electro-optical and LiDAR systems.

										</div>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">During this time, Jacob started his Masters Degree in Robotics at Georgia Tech. He also began performing 
											again at various theatre companies in the North Atlanta area. Most recently he performed in roles such as the Beast in Beauty and 
											Beast and Davey in Newsies.

										</div>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">During his Masters Degree, Jacob begun working with Dr. Fan Zhang in the Intelligence for Advanced Nuclear
											lab at Georgia Tech. He advanced their Robotics and AI research by assisting with a nuclear flow loop test bed and developing a new 
											Robotic Sensor Apparatus for autonomous plant monitoring and alerting. This RSA system ended up being his Masters Capstone Project. 
											Jacob then graduated from Georgia Tech in December of 2025 with a 3.9 GPA.

										<h2 id="content">Objectives</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I am a researcher and engineer open to new opportunities utilizing my skills 
											in Robotics and Computer Science. I have over 8 years of technical experience in engineering topics 
											such as robotics, machine learning, computer vision, automation, control systems, embedded systems, 
											electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. My skillset centers around the 
											integration of these various engineering disciplines, the quick learning and implementation of new concepts 
											(software, instrumentation, and theory), and a focus on designing various mechanical systems, 
											electrical systems, and computer systems. I am continually developing these passions and delving 
											into my field with an eagerness to learn as much as I can.</p>
